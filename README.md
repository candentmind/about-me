## My Career Passions
I really love working in tech, I love working with computers, I love problem solving and the thrill that comes from 'aha moments', it's euphoric. I love tinkering and tweaking stuffs. My goal is to become a fullstack software developer. I am also into video editing. Plus lately i've been introduced to the BBC microbit microcontroller and i'm dabbling into micropython, main python and block-based languages to become well-rounded and more versed enough to instruct, teach, lead and inspire young learners to code.
